# How it works

tgen sources the colors generated by pywal, elaborates them (creates darker and lighter variants used for over and ripple effects) and finally assemble the theme called wal.tdesktop-theme (.tdesktop-theme is the extension used for telegram themes).
I tried to write the script using bash builtins where possible, if you have ideas on how to improve it send a pr.

# Installation

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/matteoguarda/wal-telegram ~/.wal-telegram
cd ~/.wal-telegram
./tgen
# Finally open telegram, go to settings/chat background and click on select
# from file, then select wal.tdesktop-theme (generated by tgen and situated
# in your freshly cloned repo).
```

Every time you restart telegram, the latter rechanges the theme.
So, if you already use a script in combination with wal, add this line in your script:

```bash
~/.wal-telegram/tgen
```

If you don't use any script, run pywal like this: (where ... are the options you usually use)

```bash
wal ... -o ~/.wal-telegram/tgen
```

Or simply set an alias in your shell's config file:

```bash
alias wal='wal ... -o ~/.wal-telegram/tgen'
```

# Troubleshooting

If selecting wal.tdesktop-theme doesn't work, you can almost surely fix this by selecting first colors.tdesktop-theme and then background.jpg or background.png depending in your wallpaper extension.

# Updating

You can update wal-telegram by running git pull inside ~/.wal-telegram:

```bash
cd ~/.wal-telegram
git pull
```

# Important notes

Some color constants in colors.tdesktop-theme are marked as // [UNTESTED], this because I couldn't find the elements responsable in the app.
So if you find something strange open an issue (with a screenshot of the element and it's name if possible) and I'll fix.

You can also use light colorschemes, no need for extra option, just run tde normally.

The theme works with [wal] too, not just [pywal].
